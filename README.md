# FoodTruckProject

Description: The FoodTruckProject app is a user driven program. It takes in user input, and uses it to fulfill characteristics set by the program. Users can choose to input up to 5 Food Truck profiles, and can later access that information through a main menu.

Lessons Learned: While writing this program, I got a lot of practice with looping. I learned a lot about parameters and parameter passing. I also will try to take away the idea of KISS- that is: Keep It Simple Stupid. Sometimes my first idea isn't the simplest, or easiest way of getting things done. I will be trying to step away for brain breaks while working on these projects to get a fresh view on what I'm working on.

Did I enjoy it? This program was really challenging, complex, but actually really fun. The fun aspect for me came from getting the code working. The project itself seemed so daunting when it was introduced, but as I got one more step down and working I started to feel more and more confident and comfortable in my grasp of the concepts i was using.
